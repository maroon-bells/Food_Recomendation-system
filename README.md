	<h2 align="center"> Food Recomendation System </h2>
	<h4 align="center"> This is a machine learning web app, when executed, the client gets to choose a food item based on his own liking, and we recommend 10 more such similar foods through our recommendation system. Our system utilizes item-based collaborative filtering to implement the same. We provide a variety of cuisines to choose from with vegetarian/non-vegetarian options as well. <h4>
